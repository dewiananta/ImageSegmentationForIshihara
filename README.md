# ImageSegmentationForIshihara
In this task, I use a few segmentation to get best result for doing segmentation for ishihara image. Ishihara is the image for detecting is the people color blind or not. The goals of this segmentation process is to know how much the technique segmentation can get information like a character, alphabet, and number from Ishihara image.   Before to choose the type of segmentation I use the technique like HOG, Rgb to gray, median filter to do pre-processing. The steep is:  1. Preprocessing 2. Applied all type of segmentation and  comparing all segmentation to see the best result (Notes : because every picture have the different characteristic and because that the segmentation that applied can different too) 3. Choose the segmentation for every picture 4. Evaluation the segmentation every picture
